## Formal Elements


### 1. Players
* The game is intened for family audience (Ages of 12+), and will require little knowledge in video games and in how to navigate in open world. </br>
* The game is a single player campaign that is intended for one person only. </br>

### 2. Goals
* To beat the game, the player will have to venture deep in order to find his siblings and defeat monsters and overcame obstacles to return home which will be the ending. </br>
* As the siblings are teleported into a "realm" which is actually a book, the player will have to use the book in order to know where to go next ( Each chapter of the book describes a situtation the player is in ) </br> 

### 3. תהליכים

תארו בפירוט את:

* תהליך ההתחלה של המשחק - שלושים השניות הראשונות (זה הזמן ששחקן ממוצע, שייתקל במשחק שלכם באינטרנט, ישחק בו לפני שיחליט אם להמשיך או לא. מה תעשו כדי לגרום לו להישאר?);
*	תהליך הליבה של המשחק – רצף-הפעולות שהשחקן מבצע שוב ושוב על-מנת להתקדם במשחק.
*	תהליך הסיום של המשחק – הפעולות שהשחקן מבצע כדי לנצח / לסיים את המשחק.
לגבי כל תהליך, ענו על השאלות: "מי עושה מה, איפה, מתי, ואיך?".  תארו באיזה פקדים השחקן ישתמש (עכבר / מקלדת / מגע), ומה יקרה במשחק כתוצאה מכך.

איך השחקן ילמד על התהליכים? 

### 4. Rules
* The rules in the game will consist of how to move, how to climb, who are your enemies which you can attack and who are your friendly character which you can not attack, they will be explained during the game or if the player will want during a built in tutorial that will express the simple mechanics of the game.
* every action the player does in the game will have effect (negative or positive) such as helping a NPC will give the player rewards, failing jump over a clif will result in the player falling down to the abyss.

### 5. Resources
* As the game is family friendly, there wont be alot of resources only the simple ones - Health, Stamina and Exp. </br>
* Stamina is required for jumping, running and fighting, the player will have to resourcfuly use it during combat encounters as it takes a while to regenrate, Exp is for leveling up your player, it will involve in opening new skills and perks each level. </br>
* Stamina is auto regenrated, Health can be aquired by talking to a healer during the voyage, or using Health Potions that the player can find in chests or from monster drops. </br>
* By design getting exp in order to level up the character will not be that easy, the player will have to make sure he completes side quests and to help the local community he encounters during the search for his siblings. </br>
* The resources will be displayed for the player as a part of the HUD, and they will be explained during the tutorial. </br>

### 6. עימותים

מה יהיו העימותים המרכזיים במשחק:

* בין השחקן למערכת (מכשולים),
* בין השחקן לשחקנים אחרים (יריבים),
* בין השחקן לעצמו (דילמות)? 


### 7. Boundaries
* The game will consist of an open world where the player can explore many villages and cities. </br>
* The boundaries of the game will be of natural manner, such as vast open sea that surrounds a city, steep mountains that the player can't possibly climb and cliffs that will be present an option to jump from, but at what cost? :)  
* The game will have a map that will tell the player where he is at any given time, it will highlight Points of interest that the player can explore (and should) </br>
as of navigation, when the player will mark a point on the map, there will be a auto generated course to the location the player wants to go. </br>
 

### 8. Reults

* Two of the outcomes are achievable by any means, at the end, the player will be presented with the option to stay at the realm to help the locals with their ongoing crisis or to return home to his parents.

## Market Survey
 We searched in few categories, first narnia inspired games, second being sibling adventure games, and latter being teleported to another world games. </br>
[Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCvNb9CFjGs&ab_channel=%E2%98%85WishingTikal%E2%98%85) </br>
[Kya:Dark Lineage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61oZfRKJaV8)  </br>
[Forspoken](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/) </br>
[Assassin's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed) </br>
[It takes Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two/) </br>

the 3 most similar to the game we plan to create are Kya, Narnia and Forspoken for the idea they hold, in those games the players are teleported to another realm by accident.
our game will attempt to be a more dated and family oriented game that will mix into it a unique story with some fun aspects to it, such as puzzles and secrets to find.
