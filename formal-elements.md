## Market Survey
 We searched in few categories, first narnia inspired games, second being sibling adventure games, and latter being teleported to another world games. </br>
[Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCvNb9CFjGs&ab_channel=%E2%98%85WishingTikal%E2%98%85) </br>
[Kya:Dark Lineage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61oZfRKJaV8)  </br>
[Forspoken](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/) </br>
[Assassin's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed) </br>
[It takes Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two/) </br>

the 3 most similar to the game we plan to create are Kya, Narnia and Forspoken for the idea they hold, in those games the players are teleported to another realm by accident.
our game will attempt to be a more dated and family oriented game that will mix into it a unique story with some fun aspects to it, such as puzzles and secrets to find.
